I m close to 16 weeks out to my first Men's Physique contest, which is in my home town! It's a really crazy feeling that it's the little town I've grown up in. Because all my friends and family have the oppertunity to attend and cheer for me which motivates me tons! And this is as mentioned my FIRST contest ever in the Men's Physique division. When i'm doing my own check-ins I feel quite confident but i'm going up on stage with an open mind and just trying to enjoy the moment. But at the same time im killing it to take home first place.
